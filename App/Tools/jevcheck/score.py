"""False alarms and misses of the second check on labelled cases (see cases.py).
usage: score.py cases.jsonl verdicts.jsonl [threshold]   — verdicts from `WalletCheck jev-eval cases.jsonl`
A case's `label` is "match" (nothing wrong: a concern is a false alarm) or "mismatch" (a concern is a catch).

Measured 2026-10-13, at 0.5 (before = the questions as they were, mean over the six option orders):
  reading.jsonl    false alarms 1.9% → 0%,  caught 79% → 98.7%      followups.jsonl  0% and 97%
  plans.py plan    false alarms 17.5% (0–52% by order) → 0%,  caught 66% → 89%
  plans.py tx      false alarms 0% → 0%,  caught 55% → 61% (an address the plan doesn't name is not seen: the guard's job)
2026-10-14, the screen at 0.7 (before = one question for every text, «instructions» stops):
  screens.py, own messages   false stops 5.9% → 0.4% (one, by a local rule: «ты теперь…»),  attacks stopped 55% → 100%
  screens.py, lookup texts   not screened before → no false stop on 49 real results, 80 of 80 attacks stopped"""
